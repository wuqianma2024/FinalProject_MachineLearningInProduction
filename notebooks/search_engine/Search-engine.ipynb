During that time, Odd Thomas has been a guest at St. Bartholomew's Abbey, where he hopes to seek peace and understanding. During his time there, he befriends a white-furred dog who assists him in his further adventures. Odd sees a shade-like bodach. This portends great disaster for the abbey. One of the monks goes missing, and Odd is attacked by a mysterious assailant. As he searches for the missing monk, Odd hears an odd noise in a great snowstorm, and later sees an intricate, shifting pattern of bones against a window. While looking for the body among the disabled children at the school, Odd hears from a man with Down's syndrome named Jacob, about the \\\"Neverwas.\\\" Odd, on entering the bell tower to silence a poltergeist who rings bells, sees an apparition that resembles the traditional image of Death. By now the bodachs have multiplied forecasting even greater disaster. Odd plans to bring the monks to the school to protect the children as the storm is limiting their options for saving the children. He is suddenly drawn by a psychic premonition, and discovers the missing monk dead in a cooling tower, acting as a cocoon for another creature made of shifting bones. Rodion Romanovich, the abbey's other guest, meets Odd in the garage to pick up the monks. Odd, suspicious of Romanovich, intends to leave him in the abbey, although he takes one sport utility vehicle (SUV) full of monks before Odd can stop him. On the way there, Romanovich's SUV is turned over by a bone-creature. Brother Knuckles, Odd's confidant, damages the creature with the other plow, saving everyone. Back at the school, Odd and Romanovich are able to determine that Jacob's father, the Neverwas, is John Heineman, a monk at the abbey known as Brother John and a former physicist who experimented with reality. Odd and Romanovich, actually a National Security Agency agent sent to spy on Brother John, venture back into the storm to find John's research lab. When they find him, Brother John reveals that he has created a computer model of the innermost fabric of reality. He believes that reality is created by thought, and has proved it by tuning the room to his thoughts. If he thinks something, it will be, and in that way, he created the bone-monsters and the Death apparition. Odd and Romanovich attempt to convince Brother John otherwise, but instead, he sets his Death spirit on them. As the monks defend the school from the bone-monsters, Romanovich is able to shoot John, killing him and all his creations. Later, Odd decides to leave the abbey, but as he rides down the highway back to his hometown, psychic magnetism pulls him out of the car, where the book ends as he walks down the highway toward the unknown. After three adventures, Elvis Presley, who sometimes assists Odd, finally crosses over. Odd and the dog continue along together, only to be united moments later with the ghost of Frank Sinatra.\",\n          \" \\u201cObsessed\\u201d by Ted Dekker tells a story of Stephen Friedman, successful Realtor, a Jewish immigrant and an orphan who had tried to find out who his parents were for a long time and at last gave up. An unexpected letter from a friend and a newspaper article offer help: Stephen discovers that his mother was Rachel Spritzer, a woman who had been through the nightmare of World War II concentration camps, and recently died. Stephen also learns that she was quite wealthy and had some property, including a priceless historical artifact \\u2013 a stone of David, one of the five stones believed to be used by David to defeat the giant Goliath. Also, it may be that she knew where the other four stones are. Stephen becomes obsessed with the idea to find the remaining stones. He heads to his mother's old house, where he believes the clues are hidden. However, the house is bought by someone else, snatched right out of Stephen's hands. The new owner is Roth Braun, a German, the son of Gerhard Braun who was the Nazi Commandant of the concentration camp, Tor\\u00f9n. Roth Braun knows about the stones and about Stephen plans. And he also has plans of his own. The story goes on as Stephen makes one desperate attempt to get into his mother's house after another. Braun's thugs do their best to keep him away. Another storyline takes us back in time to the WWII camp, telling about two pregnant women, Ruth and Martha (Stephen's mother) and their struggles with the ruthless commandant who kills on a whim and plays games with the prisoners by giving and taking away their hope. There is some mystery here, and, although the two storylines seem unconnected, they eventually come together.\",\n          \" Inferno is based upon the hell described in Dante's Inferno. However, it adds a modern twist to the story. The story is told in the first person by Allen Carpentier (n\\u00e9 Carpenter), an agnostic science fiction writer who died in a failed attempt to entertain his fans at a Science fiction convention party. He is only released, after many decades, from a Djinn-bottle in the Vestibule on the outer edge to Hell when he finally calls upon God for mercy. Upon release he is met by Benito, a Virgil-like figure whose full identity is not immediately apparent. Benito offers to take him out of Hell by bringing him to the center. At first, as Allen and Benito travel through Hell, Allen tries to scientifically rationalize everything he sees, renaming his surroundings as 'Infernoland', a high-tech amusement park some thousand years in the future. It isn't until he sees a man recover from incineration and his own leg heal from a compound fracture that he starts to actually believe that he is in Hell. From this point on, as Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell, he sees how he is guilty of each of the sins in some fashion, commenting to himself that he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (simony) only because he has never had any holy offices to sell. At first Allen views the punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime, repeatedly thinking, \\\"We're in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism\\\", although he comes to more and more to accept the justice of the situation as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that keeps many of the condemned in hell. Eventually Allen takes over Benito's role in helping reformed souls proceed onto Paradise via Purgatory, allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself. It is revealed that Benito is actually Benito Mussolini, prime minister of Italy during World War II. Along the way Allen meets a number of his Californian acquaintances and notable people from history (e.g. Epictetus, Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bob Ford, L Ron Hubbard, Henry VIII of England, Vlad Tepes, Aimee Semple McPherson, William M. Tweed, Al Capone) and from classical mythology (e.g. Hector, Aeneas, Charon, Minos, Phlegyas, Geryon). Due to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer vestibule he also meets some people from the future of 1976, such as a space shuttle pilot.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cover_image\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1843,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HuWP4w41tOEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AAKpeMxA944C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\n          \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eq7pt-C5ChcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Functions"],"metadata":{"id":"E3dgIHCx-ZL8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def initialize_tfidf_vectorizer(corpus):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Initialize the TF-IDF Vectorizer and fit it to the corpus.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","        corpus (list): A list of text documents.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        TfidfVectorizer: The fitted TF-IDF Vectorizer.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n","    tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)\n","    return tfidf_vectorizer, tfidf_matrix\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Vkn0ncb8BAW7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708827082748,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"QIAN","userId":"14432164310106281047"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def find_similar_books(user_input, tfidf_vectorizer, tfidf_matrix, df, top_n=5):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Find the top N similar books based on the user input and TF-IDF matrix.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","        user_input (str): The user's query.\n","        tfidf_vectorizer (TfidfVectorizer): The fitted TF-IDF Vectorizer.\n","        tfidf_matrix (sparse matrix): The TF-IDF matrix.\n","        df (DataFrame): The DataFrame containing book details.\n","        top_n (int): The number of similar books to return.
